## Introduction

So here a bit of details:

- [Gradle][3] is an open source build automation system.
- Kotlin is a general purpose, open source, statically typed programming language for both functional and object-oriented programming.
- A [DSL][1] (domain-specific language) is a language specialized to a particular application domain. 
  For example `Groovy` that was created for [Gradle's build scripts][5].

Kotlin dsl with gradle means to use the kotlin `build.gradle.kts` instead of the groovy `build.gradle`.
Kotlin is so general that it reaches specific programming niche.

## Basic set up

Basic set up for your kotlin project with Gradle > **4.8** (2018), may not apply to latest [gradle releases][7]:

- group: the top level package(s) under `src.main`
- version: the version of your application

```kotlin
allprojects {
    group = "hello"
    version = "1.0"
    repositories {
        jcenter()
    }
}
```

You want to specify the kotlin version and plugin you wish to use:

```kotlin
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.3.21"
    // instead of id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.jvm") version "1.3.21"
}
```

You don't need to apply the plugin just define it, and you're good to go.
Add the basic repositories for your dependencies:

```kotlin
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven(url = "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/")
}    
```

Add dependencies like kotlin:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    compile(kotlin("stdlib-jdk8"))
    // Or compile("org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:1.3.21")
}
```

The `kotlin` key word replaces _org.jetbrains.kotlin_ you can also use it for plugins this way.

> For higher version of gradle, compile has been deprecated to implementation  

You can also add this for source compatibility:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<KotlinCompile> {
  kotlinOptions.jvmTarget = "1.8"
}
```

## Code Coverage

### JUnit

To look at coverage that means you have unit test.
Don't forget to add something like JUnit into your dependencies:

```kotlin
dependencies {
    testCompile("junit:junit:4.12")
}    
```

Also you want to use the junit platform to run your tests with google using:

```kotlin
tasks.test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

Which will use the `junit-vintage-engine` incompatible with the newer Junit5 version 
(you can recognize them by the _jupiter_ in the package name), you may encounter the `No tests found` issue
if you mix them up.

If you want to use _org.junit.jupiter:junit-jupiter:5.7.2_ with its _junit-jupiter-api_ and _junit-jupiter-engine_,
you might need to exclude junit4 modules like in springboot:

```kotlin
testImplementation("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test") {
    exclude(module = "junit")
    exclude(module = "junit-vintage-engine")
}
```

With that the `useJunitPlatform()` will use the junit5 one.

### Jacoco

#### Create code coverage task

Code coverage with jacoco plugin

```kotlin
plugins {
    jacoco
}
```

Then add the task

```kotlin
tasks.withType<JacocoReport> {
    reports {
        xml.isEnabled = true
        csv.isEnabled = false
        html.destination = file("${buildDir}/reports/jacoco")
    }
}
```

You can now roll the test code coverage with jacoco using `gradle test jacocoTestReport`.

#### Ignore a class from coverage

If you have a `main` class which can't be tested and you'd rather remove it from coverage, you would do it like:

```kotlin
tasks.withType<JacocoReport> {
    doFirst {
        classDirectories = fileTree("build/classes/kotlin/main").apply {
            exclude("**/MainKt.class")
        }
    }
    
    // ... your other stuff
    
}
```

And `MainKt` is not considered for the coverage anymore!

## Execute the project

### With the Application gradle plugin

It is a plugin available with gradle, add it to your gradle script like:

```kotlin
plugins {
    application
}
```

Then set your application main file: 

- It has to be outside a class
- The `Kt` at the end is normal, Kotlin automatically generates it for backward compatibility with Java classes

```kotlin
application {
    mainClassName = "hello.MainKt"
}

// Or you can use
application.mainClassName = "hello.MainKt"
```

Now you can run your program with:

```bash
gradle run
```

### Make the fat Jar

So the basic Jar file generated [doesnt include all you need][6] to run.
You need to include them manually by adding this (gradle 5+):


```kotlin
tasks.withType<Jar> {
    // Otherwise you'll get a "No main manifest attribute" error
    manifest {
        attributes["Main-Class"] = "com.example.MainKt"
    }

    // To add all of the dependencies otherwise a "NoClassDefFoundError" error
    from(sourceSets.main.get().output)

    dependsOn(configurations.runtimeClasspath)
    from({
        configurations.runtimeClasspath.get().filter { it.name.endsWith("jar") }.map { zipTree(it) }
    })
}
``` 

The jar will be created as `{project.name}-{version}.jar` like `hello-kotlin-1.0.jar`.
You can then run it using:

```bash
java -jar hello-kotlin-1.0.jar
```

You can also create another task `fatJar` that would create the jar with all of your dependencies.
Follow the documentation on [gradle][2].

### Make the wrapper

For your project to work almost anywhere, you can use the wrapper:

```
# To use the installed gradle version as wrapper
gradle wrapper 
# To specify the gradle version
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.8 --distribution-type all
```

Then you'll be able to use `./gradlew` instead of gradle, and your project should run fine 👍

> Now if you have the opportunity to use a newer version of gradle, do it.

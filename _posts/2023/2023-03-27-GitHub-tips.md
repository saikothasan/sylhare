Here is a curated list of tips that should work on GitHub, some might be more obscure than others or could be interesting
to note. If you are looking more tips and secrets, the [GitHub blog][1] have some articles available about [tricks][2] and
[hacks][3]. There's a finite amount of them, so you may see some of them there too.

## GitHub flavoured Markdown

### Keyboard keys

This one is not really GitHub only, but pretty cool to know when you want to give keyboard keys to type. It adds an 
overlay around the text:

- For example: <kbd> ctrl </kbd>, using

```html
<kbd> ctrl </kbd>
```

And as you guessed it _kbd_ is short for _keyboard_ hence the look.

### Expandable

For expandable content, or [details][12] as it's called in the HTML world:

```html
<details>
    <summary>Click here!</summary>
    hidden until you click
</details>
```

Which should render similarly in GitHub:

<details>
    <summary>Click here!</summary>
    hidden until you click
</details>

### Diagram

For diagrams, you have the possibility to use [mermaidJS][11], directly within GitHub which was [announced][9] in 2022:

{% highlight markdown %}
```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```
{% endhighlight %}

Which should display a diagram like this one:

<div class="mermaid">
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
</div>

They have been [working][10] with Mermaid's creator to incorporate the library to the GitHub flavoured markdown for inline
graphs

### Links

Markdown links, this one is more generic, but a nice trick, there are several ways to add links in markdown:

- With the link directly after:
  ```markdown
  [my blog](https://sylhare.github.io)
  ```
- With the link at the bottom and a reference in the text:
  ```markdown
  [my blog][1]
  
  [1]: https://sylhare.github.io
  ```
- Using the text as the reference for the link at the bottom
  ```markdown
  [my blog]
  
  [my blog]: https://sylhare.github.io
  ```

I tend to prefer the second one, as it looks better than using the text and can be used at more than one place.
Also, GitHub auto provides anchors on title in the Readme which you can access directly using `#`, For example, you
could use `[click here][#Links]` to get to the links title on the same page.

### Colors

Use the backticks on hex colours to display them with a coloured square next to it:

```markdown
Look at these colors `#0087d5`, `#FF66dd`, `#5BCD98`
```

{% include aligner.html images="github_hex_colors.png" column=1 %}

A nice touch ðŸ‘Œ

## GitHub features

### File finder

Last one is not even related to the markdown, but if you are [looking for a file][8] using <kbd> t </kbd> gives 
you the ability to search through the files in the repo which can be handy to find what you're looking for faster.

{% include aligner.html images="github_file_finder.png" column=1 %}

This functionality is referenced as the _File Finder_ received some [makeover][7], you can [customize][7] from which
folder to look for using the `linguist` in the `.gitattributes`.

By default, it ignores everything from the `vendor/` and `build/` folder, because it's usually external or generated code,
not pertinent to search from.
To mark the file `search/example.json` as a generated file to be ignored, add this line to `.gitattributes`:

```bash
search/example.json linguist-generated=true
```

And it won't show up in the search results. There's also a `linguist-vendored` you can use, checkout the [documentation][13].


### For Pull Requests

#### Template

You can add a [Pull Request template][5] to your repository, it can be in multiple places (root, docs) but I prefer to 
have it in the _.github/_ folder

Create a file called `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and then add within it what you'd want your Pull Request to have by 
default when opening it. Don't add too much though, as it can be a bit of a turn-off to have to remove the text each 
time if it's never needed. 

For example:

```markdown
### Description
<!-- What your PR is about -->

### Screenshot
<!-- If you've modified the UI -->
```

The HTML comment won't be shown once saved and allow for simple indications on what to put.
If you like saving time, the same can be done for the [issues][6]! And if you are using issues, you may also want to try
the [saved replies][4] features for automating some common answers you might give in an open source project.

#### Code Review

For PRs to make a suggestion that can then be committed by the PR's author if interested (either one at a time or in
bulk). Useful to fix a type on the fly:

{% highlight markdown %}Missing space:

```suggestion
Check it out!
```
{% endhighlight %} 

So your suggestion can be committed from within the code review message, if you just put the suggestion it will show up
ad suggested change, so I tend to add an extra message to it, so it's less raw. Your fellow dev might like some 
additional context if you're suggesting something more complex ðŸ™ƒ

{% include aligner.html images="github_suggestion.png" column=1 %}

If you are using `git diff`, you can also use the highlighter `diff` so it makes it more readable. However, if readability
is the goal, it's better to go straight into the `file` section of the PR. ðŸ¤·

Also in the readability part, you can click on the top left of a file to display it all. This usually helps grasp the 
context on bigger file where it can become tedious to repeatedly click on the expand button to see the code around.

Have you ever wanted to start writing Japanese 🇯🇵 without investing in a some special hardware?
It could be part of your learning journey or to say ありがとう to a friend! 
Then you are in luck because you can just do that from the comfort of your old keyboard on Mac (OSX).

## Set up

### Enable the keyboard

You can [set][1] your Mac to use your keyboard as a Japanese input source (Romaji, Hiragana, Katakana).

For that go to:

- Apple menu > System Preferences > click Keyboard
- Click on the <kbd>+</kbd> button and select `Japanese`
- Click on the 'Add' button, and you should now see it on your screen

Bravo, you've done it! おめでとう御座います!! 🎉

### shortcuts

You should be able to switch language using icon on the top bar. There are even some handy shortcut (to easily switch
once you've selected one of the three):

- <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>⬆</kbd> + <kbd>;</kbd> for Romaji (A)
- <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>⬆</kbd> + <kbd>J</kbd> for Hiragana (あ)
- <kbd>^</kbd> + <kbd>⬆</kbd> + <kbd>K</kbd> for Katakana (ア)

## Usage

If you are using a western keyboard (i.e. QWERTY) it will transform automatically the letters into hiragana / katakana,
and you'll be able to select kanji or different typing.

Capslock does not exist in Japanese, so it will switch to romaji or an emoji, if you try for example to write a caps あ →
A or 🅰️.

Also the romaji doesn't handle the accents, usually done by pressing a key more than 1 seconds. That's because there are
no accent equivalent in Japanese.

## Examples

I did use the japanese input to write it all done, and it needs some getting use to. Don't forget to validate your kana
by pressing enter twice before trying to move around your cursor with the keyboard's arrows.

### What, Which, Where, Why

All of them can be written with 何 so I grouped them together.

A `What` question using 何 (なん or なに)
- 彼女 は 何 を もっていますか
- _What does she have?_

A `Which` question using どれ or 何れ 
- どれ が あなた の 本 ですか
- _Which is your book?_

A `Where` question using どこ or 何処
- 私 の 白いシャツ は どこに ありますか
- _Where is my white shirt?_

A `Why` question using なぜ or 何故
- なぜ あなた は それ を 言うの ですか
- _Why do you say that?_

> なぜ is more formal in contrast with:
> - 如何して (どうして) which is less formal and to say _in what way?_
> - 何で (なんで) which is very much informal used to say _for what?_

### Who and Whose

Adding a _の_ like for _se_ makes a who into a whose.

A `Who` question with (だれ or 誰)
- あの 男の人 は 誰 ですか
- _Who is that man? (over there)_

A `Whose` question using 誰の
- それ コート は 誰の ですか
- _Whose coat is it?_

### How, When

Let's be thorough and add some more example shall we:

A `How` question using どう
- 彼 は どう ですか
- _How is he?_

A `When` question with いつ
- 彼女 は いつ 食べますか
- _When does she eat?_

[Jenkins][1] is an open source automation server that is often used as a CI/CD tool to run your automated tests and deployment
pipeline.
It was created in 2011, a while back and has a range of [possibilities][10] because of its compatibility with multiple
version control tools and scripting. There was a [feud][10] with Oracle's Hudson (now deprecated) with Jenkins each considered the fork of the other one, 
both having a butler as a logo.

Enough history, Let's check it out!

### UI

[Blue Ocean][7] is the name of the new UI look of jenkins, which is more on part with what's existing with [GitLab ci][8].
The older UI is also called Classic UI and is still accessible if you want to burn your eyes or access the advanced settings,
like you used to.

{% include aligner.html images="jenkins-blue-ocean.png" column=1 %}

Example from [jenkins][9] of the new UI being used.
Each step is clickable, the logs are ordered by steps and can be expanded which is much neater than a big chunk of logs.

### Syntax

Jenkins' files are written in groovy, and you will most likely find `#!/usr/bin/env groovy` or similar at the top
signaling that the syntax should be interpreted as groovy.

#### Pipeline base

The hierarchy works as follows, pipeline > stages > stage > steps, the executable action should be within the `steps` part.
The stage's name will be displayed within the [Blue Ocean][7]'s view.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent { docker { image 'ruby:3.0.3-alpine' } }
    stages {
        stage('build') {
            steps {
                sh 'ruby --version'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The agent is what will be used to run the executable parts, here it's a docker, but you could use it with a label within
your organisation with a label such as `agent { label 'large' }`.
You can also set in your `pipeline` the [environment][6] which can be used across your stages.

```groovy
environment {
    VERSION = "3.0.3-alpine" 
}
```

Which can then be used as `env.VERSION` or within a bash script as `${env.VERSION}`. However, the value is immutable and
can't be reassigned later.

#### Parallel Steps

You can also use [parallel][5] to run two stages and their step at the same time within a stage.
The parallel can't be dangling right below `stages` which means you may need to get creative for that wrapper stage's 
name. Here I called it "_Integration_", I guess that's good enough for the example ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

```groovy
stage('Integration') {
  parallel {
    stage('Contract tests') {
      steps {
        // ...implementation
      }
    }
    stage('Smoke tests') {
      steps {
        // ...implementation
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can run two independent steps in parallel, potentially saving time on your overall pipeline time. As shown by the UI
before, you can stack as many stages as you want in parallel, keep in mind that you'll still need an agent and an infrastructure 
that can match your enthusiasm.

#### Retry, timeout, input

There are some other pre-defined functions, let's see an example of the [most common ones][12].

```groovy
steps {
    retry(3) { /* ... */ }
    timeout(time: 3, unit: 'MINUTES') { /* ... */ }
}
```

Those two `step` needs to be run within a `steps` block:
- Retry is pretty straightforward and will execute in this example up to 3 times what's inside the block
- Timeout will wait until the set time (here 3minutes) before executing what's inside the block

There's also another one [input][13] which is situated at the `stage` level and will ask for a user input, perfect
if you need to manually parametrize your build:

```groovy
stage('Example') {
    input {
        message "Should we continue?"
        ok "Yes, we should."
        submitter "alice,bob"
        parameters {
            string(name: 'PERSON', defaultValue: 'Mr Jenkins', description: 'Who should I say hello to?')
        }
    }
    steps {
        echo "Hello, ${PERSON}, nice to meet you."
    }
}
```

You can see here that the `PERSON` variable is not declared before and is assigned to the value set in the input.
You can also use a different type of input with `$class` and a [parameter definition][14] class such as `ChoiceParameterDefinition`,
for a choice (a dropdown list) as a parameter input:

```groovy
[$class: 'ChoiceParameterDefinition', choices: 'yes\nno', description: 'Am I a pipeline?', name: 'ANSWER']
```

You can see that the choices are separated from each other by a `\n`, the rest stays similar. If you need an example
on how to use the parameter's definition class, you can always find some on GitHub from famous open source projects.

#### Scripts

You can also use some code in those groovy jenkins files, since the variable defined in the environment are immutable,
you can declare actual variables using `def variableName = 'hello world'`.

You can define those variables outside the `pipeline` block, as well as creating other methods. If you want to add
some logic from within a step you would need to use a `script` block:

```groovy
step {
    script {
        def browsers = ['chrome', 'firefox']
        for (int i = 0; i < browsers.size(); ++i) {
            echo "Testing the ${browsers[i]} browser"
        }
    }
}
```

You can also have, _if_/_else_, _try_/_catch_ in your [scripted pipeline][11], but usually you'll want to extract big 
complex block of logic into a shared library to keep your pipeline lean.

#### Customization

You can create [shared libraries][3] in jenkins to reduce redundancy when working with  multiple pipeline, 
for that you'll need to write your steps in groovy in a `vars` folder and the name of the file in camelCase will be 
its identifier. 
For complex steps, you can also have some groovy class in a `src` folder.

```groovy
//vars/withMainBranch.groovy
def call(Closure body) {
    if (env.BRANCH_NAME =~ /main/) {
        body()
    }
}
```

The `Closure` type is when the step is called with a _block_ aka something within `{ .. }`, the body within that block
can then be executed. For in this example, the block will only be executed if the `BRANCH_NAME` (which is a default Jenkins
env variable) matches `main`:

```groovy
withMainBranch {
    echo "This is the main branch"
}
```

You have the possibility to declare more than one behaviour, like this simple example from the
jenkins [documentation][4] where the `log` steps gets defined with two functions:

```groovy
//In vars/log.groovy
def info(message) {
    echo "INFO: ${message}"
}

def warning(message) {
    echo "WARNING: ${message}"
}
```

You can also have a matching a `log.txt` with some information on how to use it. 
Which can then be imported and be used by calling the file name as a method, such as:

```groovy
@Library('utils') _

log.info 'Starting'
log.warning 'Nothing to do!'
```

It will print out in the log the information as specified by the script.

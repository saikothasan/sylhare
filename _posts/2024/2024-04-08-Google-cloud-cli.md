Google Cloud, also sometimes referred to as the GCP (Google Cloud Platform) is a cloud computing platform that offers hosting, 
storage, and a wide range of services to deploy and manage applications (Kubernetes, VMs, Serverless functions ...).

You have access to it through the [console.cloud.google.com][2] website and the CLI (Command Line Interface) `gcloud` to 
manage your deployments and application.

In this article, we'll look at how to get set up with the Google Cloud CLI and some useful tips to get started.

## CLI Set up

### Installation

Find the installation guide on [cloud.google.com][1], download the google-cloud-cli package for your distribution.
Extract it, and move the file to a proper place as it'll be added to your path once installed (like in `usr/locale`).

Then run within the extracted folder _google-cloud-sdk_, the installation script:

```bash
sh install.sh
```      

If Python is not installed, it will prompt you to do it. Once installed, you can open a new terminal
or source your rc file (e.g. `./zshrc`) to get access to the `glcoud` command.

Once installed, you can read the commands available with:

```bash
gcloud cheat-sheet
```

This will display a `man` type of documentation with useful gcloud commands and their explanations.

### Log in

Once installed, initialize it with:

```bash
gcloud init
```

It will prompt you to log in, which will bring you to an SSO screen to log in with your email address.
Then you will set the cloud project to use by default. 
Optionally, you can set a default _compute_ region, usually you should choose a region that is geographically close to you
or the intended user, to reduce latency.

This is the project in which you will create resources, and it determines your usage and billing.

The `init` will save the credentials in a file in `~/.config/gcloud/`. 

### Get started

You can browse the project and its deployment online through the [console.cloud.google.com][2].

```bash
# Find all available projects
gcloud projects list
# Find the current project's id
gcloud config list project --format "value(core.project)"
```

To see the available projects, if you didn't set a default one before, 
you can do so via `gcloud config set project <project>`, then you can list the available clusters in that project:

```bash
gcloud container clusters list
```

If you don't have a cluster, you can create one using `gcloud container clusters create my-gke-cluster`, you will need 
a cluster to be able to create a deployment. 
A project is where you can create clusters is a group of nodes (machine running the applications) 
which are belonging to the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE). A _GKE_ corresponds to one Kubernetes (k8s) cluster.
Find out more about Kubernetes in this [article][10].

## Deployment

Google cloud has different _compute services_ offerings, we are using the _Kubernetes Engine_ for our deployment.

### Via the UI

Via the UI, you can create a deployment by going to the [Kubernetes Engine][4] page, then click on the _Deploy_ button.
By default, it will prompt you to create a simple nginx deployment:

{% include aligner.html images="gcloud-deploy.png" column=1 %}

It's very straight forward, click next, next, next and ok to get your first deployment up and running.
You can try it out, but we'll see next how to do the same via the CLI.

### Via the CLI

#### From a repository

To deploy an app from an image created through a repository, you will need to have [Cloud Source Repositories API][3],
else you will have to use an existing public image (i.e. from DockerHub).

```bash
# Assuming you are in a project with a Dockerfile
gcloud run deploy --source .
```

And it should work flawlessly, unless you are trying to deploy a new image without the correct permissions.
Which will give you an error like this one:

```bash
ERROR: (gcloud.run.deploy) PERMISSION_DENIED: Permission 'artifactregistry.repositories.create' denied on resource '//artifactregistry.googleapis.com/projects/<project id>/locations/<zone>' (or it may not exist).
# To add the permission (if you have the rights)
gcloud projects add-iam-policy-binding YOUR_PROJECT_ID \
  --member="user:USER_EMAIL" \
  --role="roles/artifactregistry.writer"
```

If you manage to fix your permissions (You might need to use some elevated access or a different user),
and it still doesn't work, you will need to either enable it via `gcloud services enable container.googleapis.com`.

#### From an image

If you still want to test it out without this permission, you can still try it out with already available images.
So let's do it with a nginx server instead. 
For that, we are going to create a kubernetes context from a cluster, so it deploys in Google CLoud.
First you need the `gke-gcloud-auth-plugin` authentication:

```bash
# First install the plugin
gcloud components install gke-gcloud-auth-plugin
```

Then you can select an existing cluster or try to create a new one in your project.
If you've selected a project before via the CLI (as mentioned earlier), you can skip the `--project` flag.

```bash
# List the clusters
gcloud container clusters list
# Or create a new one
gcloud container clusters create <cluster-name> --zone <zone> --project <project>
```

Next, you will need to create a context for the cluster, and for that you will need to know the project and the zone
you want to create it in.
For the zones, if you haven't selected one, you can choose from the available list:

```bash
gcloud container zones list
# NAME                       REGION                   STATUS  NEXT_MAINTENANCE  TURNDOWN_DATE
# us-east1-b                 us-east1                 UP
# us-east1-c                 us-east1                 UP
# ...
```

Now you should have all the information needed to create your cluster.
This cluster is a Kubernetes cluster managed by the Google Kubernetes Engine in the Google Cloud Platform.

```bash
# Create the context
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <cluster> --zone <zone> --project <project>
```

It will update your `~/.kube/config` file and add a new Google cloud CLI Kubernetes context to it. 
This will allow you to interact with your cloud cluster directly with the `kubectl` commands.
You can check that it worked using:

```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

And you should see the one called `gke-<project>-<zone>-<cluser>` in there. Use `kubectl config set-context <context>` to
switch back at any time to another one.

Now you can use the default k8s commands to create your deployment:

```bash
kubectl create deployment test --image=nginx:latest  
kubectl expose deployment test --type=LoadBalancer --port 80 --target-port 8080
```

And now if you check online, in the gcloud console, you'll see your deployment. It might take a few seconds for it to be
totally up and running.

{% include aligner.html images="gcloud-deployment.png" column=1 %}

Now if you [execute a command][10] locally via `kubectl` to scale up/down or change the deployment in any way, 
you will see that the "local" (but not so local because it's actually running in GCP) changes are reflected in the cloud console.

## Conclusion

Now you are all set to work with Google Cloud from your terminal, you can create and manage your deployments from there
as if it was running on your machine.
But remember to kill deployments that you are not using anymore as cloud costs can quickly escalate.

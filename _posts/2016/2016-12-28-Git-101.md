## Git commands

Some basic git commands and what they do.

### Simple workflow to get started

Let say you have set up your repository, you can access it via [ssh]({% post_url 2017/2017-04-19-Get-started-with-GitHub %})
or https. You have its link (we usually prefer via SSH, but the commands are the same with both).

You first clone the repository:

```bash
# Cloning a repo via ssh
git clone git@github.com:sylhare/Type-on-Strap.git
```

You can do some modification, review them using and prepare your commit

```bash
# Review the state of repo
git status
# Add a the file name `new_file.md`
git add new_file.md
# Or add everything you've modified
git add --All
```

If you redo `git status`, you will see the changes you have added are now `staged`. You can commit them and push it to _
remote_ using:

```bash
# Create a commit with a message using
git commit -m "Add new_file.md"
```

If you can't push your commit with `git push` directly you may need to pull the first few changes first.
Here is how it would look like on the git history:

<div class="mermaid">
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base' } }%%
      gitGraph
        commit
        branch remote
        commit
        checkout main
        commit
        checkout remote
        commit
        commit
        checkout main
        merge remote
        commit
</div>

Pulling while rebasing allow you to avoid some conflict by replaying the commits from older to newer from both
the remote branch and the main branch:

```bash
# Make sure you have the last version of the repo, the --rebase for a smoother pull 
git pull --rebase
# Push your commit to remote
git push 
```

### See log of the repository

Use:

```bash
git log
```

To exit `git log` type `q` on the terminal. For more magic with `git log` check out [Magic stats with git]({% post_url
2019/2019-07-28-Magic-stats-with-git %})

### Stash changes

This can be used when you are updating your local repository with the remote one and avoid conflicts. For example when
you have changes not committed, and you need to pull before a commit. A basic workflow would be to stash, pull, commit
and re apply your stash.

```bash
# To save your local changes as 'stash'
git stash 
# To delete a stash
git drop <stash sha>

# To get back the last modification from stash and delete it
git pop 
# To get the local changes from a stash and keep it
git apply <stash sha>
```

### Create a branch

Get the state and branches of the repository:

```bash
# See the repo remotely
git remote -v
# See the branch locally
git branch
```

Create and checkout on a new branch:

```bash
# Create the branch
git branch patch-1
# Go inside the branch
git checkout patch-1
```

All the commits made on that new branch will stay on that branch.
Only when you merge the commit will be added to the main branch:

<div class="mermaid">
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base' } }%%
      gitGraph
        commit
        commit
        commit
        branch patch-1
        commit
        commit
</div>

Create a branch and checkout in one line from a new local one or by tracking an existing remote one:

```bash
# Create a branch locally and checkout in one line
git checkout -b patch-1
# Add a remote branch and fetch it
git checkout --track origin/patch-1
```

### Revert a commit

Commits are identified by a special number, a commit hash (SHA) like `860652a4ab3749a72401b2ceaacf68b27afbc404`. It can
also be identified with the first 7 numbers like `860652a`

To revert you need to use:

```bash
git revert 860652a 
```

Which will revert the commit [`860652a`](). The HEAD be at the previous commit state:

<div class="mermaid">
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'base' } }%%
      gitGraph
        commit id: "86052a"
        commit id: "Revert 86052a" type: REVERSE
</div>

You can also revert multiple commits from HEAD using:

```bash
git revert --no-commit HEAD~3..
```

This way you can revert the last 3 commits (The `..` creates the range).

> This will not work if some commits are "merge commits"

If you don't want to use a "revert" commit to remove your change, you can also rebase and drop the commit.

### Amend a commit

When you have made a mistake, or you want to modify your last commit. (Usually the one not pushed to master)
Try using:

```bash
git commit --amend
# Amend commit with change of author
git commit --amend --author="John Doe <john@doe.org>"
```

It will allow you to change the commit name, and the modifications included in the commit. If you want to modify
multiple commits you can also do:

```bash
git rebase -i HEAD~4 -x "git commit --amend --author 'John Doe <john@doe.org>' --no-edit"
```

> You may need to force push, or if the branch is protected, you will need to temporarily disable that protection, or your changes will be rejected.

### Rename multiple commits

Using rebase:

```bash
# To return three commits back
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

You will see the commits, use `reword` in the one to change. Validate by doing:

```bash
git rebase --continue
```

At the end, to push remote, don't forget to add `--force`. Bear in mind that you'll mess up the history for whoever had
a previous version. So use with caution.

If your commit started with `#` which is by default a comment, 
and you want to keep it in your git message during the rebase.
You can change the comment symbol using:

```bash
git config core.commentChar ";"
# Then put it back with
git config core.commentChar "#"
```

### Push only a commit at a time

When you have multiple commits in waiting. Or during/after a rebase. You can select the SHA of the commits you want to
push and execute:

```bash
git push <remotename> <commit SHA>:<remotebranchname>
```

### Other tips

#### Remote folder and repository links

Remove a folder from git but not local:

```bash
git rm -r --cached myFolder
```

Remove a folder from git:

```bash
    git remote add <remote nickname> https://github.com/user/repository
    git rm -r one-of-the-directories
    git commit -m "Remove duplicated directory"
    git push origin <your-git-branch> # typically 'master', but not always	
```

Send an empty commit to trigger the pipeline:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "trigger pipeline"
```

[Postman](https://www.postman.com/) ðŸ“¬ is a tool to easily send Rest, SOAP and GraphQL queries. It is one of the popular
tool in its category among some alternative like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [paw](https://paw.cloud/) (for
Mac).

Postman is using and sharing open source libraries, you can also [contribute](https://github.com/postmanlabs) to its
major modules!

### Basics

#### Make API calls

The basic feature of [Postman](https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/) is to be able to save
your API calls in one place under a _collection_. This is far more convenient that having some curl request saved
somewhere.

Being able in a couple of click to send requests to your API, is must!
Setting headers and payload, sending the request to that precise endpoint and receiving the response is useful for
development as well as support (for production apps).

#### Authentication

You can set the [authorization](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/authorization/) for all of your API
calls directly from your collection's page. It will be passed down to each call with the correct header.

You can also override manually the authorization directly from the call in the _Authorization_ section,
changing `Inherit auth from parent` to whichever you like.

It provides a variety of options, which support modern Authorization methods, with roles and token like in OAuth2.

#### Collaborate

Also, you can on the free version export / imports collections for/from your colleagues, so they can use the queries
you've built. 

It does require a bit of logistic to keep one version of truth (usually saving the export in a git repo).
That's why they released in the paid version, some [collaboration](https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/collaboration-intro/) features. 
There's workplace where everything is online, which removes the need to export / import,
it works a bit like a git repository for collections directly within postman.

### Environments and variables

You can set up different [environments](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/) and
[variables](https://learning.postman.com/docs/sending-requests/variables/) with postman. So you have the same query
for _Staging_ and _Prod_, you only need to change the environment to switch your query. Fewer modifications to make
means less chance of a human error.

![env]({{ "assets/img/postman_env.jpeg" | relative_url }})

There's a hierarchy of variable, which can be set and overridden:
- _temporary_: access with `pm.variables`
- _data variables_: can be set from Runner using a data file. 
- _environment_: access from UI and `pm.environment`
- _collection_ variables: access from UI (edit collection) or `pm.collectionVariables`
- _globals_: access from UI and `pm.globals`

![var]({{ "assets/img/postman_var.jpeg" | relative_url }})

Once you set your environment variable you will be able to use it in your API call, for example for an url:

```coffeescript
{% raw %}{{base_url}}{% endraw %}/api/v1/petshop
```

This way depending on your environment the value of `base_url` will change.

### Postman scripting

Postman provides a
javascript-like [library](https://learning.postman.com/docs/writing-scripts/script-references/postman-sandbox-api-reference/)
to script your calls. You can access it using `pm` (for postman) in the _Pre-request Scripts_ or _Tests_ part of your
call.

Both works the same way, the difference is that _Pre-request_'s script will be executed before the call, and _Tests_'s
script will be executed after the call.

### Pre-request example

As a _Pre-request Scripts_ you could for an authenticated request, send a request to get an access token to store it in
your variable before making a call to your API endpoint:

```js
pm.sendRequest("https://" + pm.collectionVariables.get("base_url") + "/api/v1/authorize", function (err, response) {
    pm.variables.set("token", response.json()["token"]);
});
```

We get the `base_url` from the collection which returns a payload with a token that we access and store in a temporary
variable called `token`.

### Test example

For a Test, you can also after a request keep some information (like an id) for a subsequent call:

```js
var jsonData = pm.response.json();
console.log(jsonData.petshop.id)
pm.collectionVariables.set("petshopId", jsonData.petshop.id);
```

That's basic, but fits many cases. You could also do an actual test from the received data:

```js
pm.test("response should be okay to process", function () {
    pm.response.to.not.be.error;
    pm.response.to.have.jsonBody('');
    pm.response.to.not.have.jsonBody('error');
});
```

This is more like a pre-check before actually parsing the data of the response, to make the error messages clearer when
using the calls. I don't think you should replace your in-code unit, integration, e2e tests with postman tests.
